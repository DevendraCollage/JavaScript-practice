//? Rules for choosing variable names
//* => letters, digits, underscore, & $ sign allowed
//* => Must begin with $, _, or  letter
//* => JavaScript reserved words cannot be used as a variable name
//* => Dev & dev are different variable (case-sensitive)

//? Like you can create variable in JS
let numDemo = 10;
console.log(numDemo);

var a = 7;
let a = 7; // Declaring variables
// a is an identifier
// = is an assignment operator
// 7 is a literal
